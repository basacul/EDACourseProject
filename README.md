## Assignment

In this assignment we looked at data from the EPA which monitors the air in different States of the US. By processing the data and plotting them according to the questions, the goal was to provide a clear and easy to understand plot for answering them.

## In this repository

You can find all the .R scripts for each of its plots. The two .RDS files belong to the data set and provide the input for the scripts.
